// As well, you can see here that we're wrapping the system allocator.  If you want, you can construct `Allocator` by
// wrapping another allocator that implements `GlobalAlloc`.  Since this is a static, you need a way to construct ther
// allocator to be wrapped in a const fashion, but it _is_ possible.
